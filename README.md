# I'm OK with cookies
List of filters for Adblock Plus that block cookie notices on European websites

##Why this list?
According to European laws, every website that uses cookies must notify its users.
While this is great for transparency and digital literacy, some of us know how to manage their cookies and can be annoyed with all the banners and modal windows when you go on an European website.
This Adblock list hide those elements so you don't have to have to click on OK every time you go on one of those websites.

##How to use it?
You first need to install [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/).

Once it is installed, go to *Tools > Adblock Plus > Filter preferences…*. Then click on *Add filter subscription… > Add a different subscription*.

You need to put this URL in the *Filter list location* field:
